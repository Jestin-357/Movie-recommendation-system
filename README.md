# Movie-recommendation-systemsystem
This project builds a content-based Movie Recommendation System using Python, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn. 
It processes movie metadata, extracts relevant features (genres, keywords, cast, and crew), and applies Machine Learning (ML) techniques to suggest similar movies.
